In addition, the process of distributing the reaction system in a digital PCR experiment may greatly reduce the concentration of a background sequence that competes with a target sequence locally, and thus digital PCR is particularly suitable for detection of a rare mutation in a complex background, and is currently mostly applied in liquid biopsies to achieve detection of rare mutation markers in peripheral blood of tumor patients.'},\n",

(The reasons are that, as for other classes of single-stranded pre-products: part of the single-stranded pre-products cannot be annealed with the probe at the stage of PCR cylic amplification to form double-stranded products due to a lower annealing temperature; and the other part of the single-stranded pre-products can be annealed with the probe at the stage of PCR cylic amplification to form double-stranded products because of a high annealing temperature, but since such double-stranded products have a melting temperature lower than a signal acquisition temperature, the resulting double-stranded products are also in a single-stranded state at the signal acquisition temperature) Therefore, by adopting the above PCR detection method, there can be at most one kind of signal of the target nucleic acid among signals from each signal channel acquisition, and if the target nucleic acid is not presented, there is no signals of the target nucleic acid.'},\n",

After PCR amplification is completed, signal acquisition is performed at a relatively low first signal acquisition temperature (11). At this time, a probe signal detection region (H) of the probe (P1-12) is reversely and complementarily paired with the reverse complementary sequence (h1') of the primer signal detection region of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S1), the primer anchoring region (A1') of the probe (P1-12) is reversely and complementarily paired with the probe anchoring region (A1) at the 5' end of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S1), to obtain a hybrid double-stranded product (D1) formed with the probe (P1-12), while the reverse complementary sequence (M') of the extension block region at the 3' end of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S1) is not complementary with any parts of the probe (P1-12) and the target sequence; and at this time, part of sequences of the probe (P1-12) changes from a single-stranded state to a double-stranded state, and the distance between a first detection group and a second detection group changes, thus generating a signal that can be detected by an instrument. While at this time, both the reverse complementary sequence (h2') of the primer signal detection region at the 3' end of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S2) and the reverse complementary sequence (h3') of the primer signal detection region at the 3' end of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S3) have annealing temperatures that are lower than the first annealing temperature (T1) and the first signal acquisition temperature (t1), and thus are not reversely complementary with the probe signal detection region (H) of the probe (P1-12) and do not generate extending; after the completion of the first signal acquisition at the first signal acquisition temperature (t1), a secondary amplification cycle of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S2) is performed with a cycle condition of high-temperature melting, and annealing is performed at a relatively low second annealing temperature (T2) (T2 < T1, and T2 < 11), at which time, the probe signal detection region (H) of the probe (P1-12) is complementarily paired with the reverse complementary sequence (h2') of the primer signal detection region at the 3' end of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S2), the primer anchoring region (A2') of the probe is reversely and complementarily paired with the probe anchoring region (A2) at the 5' end of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S2), the 3' end of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S2) may continue extending to the 5' end of the probe (P1-12), to obtain all reverse complementary sequences of the probe (P1-12), i.e., completing secondary amplification with the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S2) as a primer and the probe (P1-12) as a template, and an amplified double-stranded product (D2) formed with the probe (P1-12) is obtained, at which time, all sequences of the probe (P1-12) change from the single-stranded state to the double-stranded state, and the distance between the first detection group and the second detection group changes, thus generating a signal;

after the completion of the second signal acquisition at the second signal acquisition temperature (t2), a secondary amplification cycle of the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S3) is performed with a cycle condition of high-temperature melting, and annealing is performed at a lower third annealing temperature (T3) (T3 < T2, and T3 < t2), at which time, the probe signal detection region (H) of the probe (P1-12) is complementarily paired with the reverse complementary sequence (h3') of the primer signal detection region at the 3' end of the single pre-amplification product (S3), the primer anchoring region (A3') of the probe is reversely and complementarily paired with the probe anchoring region (3A) at the 5' end of the single pre-amplification product (S3), the 3' end of the single pre-amplification product (S3) may continue extending to the 5' end of the probe (P1-12), to obtain part or all of reverse complementary sequences of the probe (P1-12), i.e., completing secondary amplification with the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S3) as a primer and the probe (P1-12) as a template, to obtain an amplified double-stranded product (D2) formed with the probe (P1-12), at which time, all or part of sequences of the probe (P1-12) changes from a single-stranded state to a double-stranded state, and the distance between the first detection group and the second detection group changes, thus generating a signal; after the completion of cyclic amplification at the third annealing temperature (T3), the temperature is increased to a higher third signal acquisition temperature (t3) for a second signal acquisition (t3 > t2, an t3 > T2), at which time, since the third signal acquisition temperature (t3) is higher than the melting temperature of the hybrid double-stranded product (D1), the hybrid double-stranded product (D1) formed by the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S1) and the probe (P1-12) cannot form a double-stranded structure;

while the amplified double-stranded product (D3) formed by the single-stranded pre-amplification product (S3) and the probe (P1-12) form a double-stranded state, the distance between the first detection group and the second detection group becomes longer, and the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer is relatively low, so that a fluorescence signal changes and can be detected by an instrument.\"},\n",
