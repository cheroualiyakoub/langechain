      "[PARAGRAPH] Technical field\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] [0001]\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceuticals, and in particular to phosphorus-containing\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] compound, preparation method thereof, and use for treating dry eye.\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] Technical background\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] [0002]\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] Tears provide long-lasting moisturization and lubrication to the eyes, which is the key to maintaining vision and\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] eye comfort. Tears are composed of water, lipids, mucus, antibodies, and specific proteins with anti-infective properties.\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] These components are secreted by specific glands located around the eyes. When there is an imbalance in the tear\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] system, people will feel dry eyes.\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] [0003]\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] Dry eye syndrome is a common ocular surface inflammatory disease. People with dry eye may experience eye\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] pain, photosensitivity, itching, redness and blurred vision. Dry eye syndrome is caused by multiple inducing factors,\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] including age, gender, environment, medicine, surgery, and systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes,\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] thyroid disease, and lymphoma. If dry eye disease is not diagnosed and treated properly, it may lead to further\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] complications such as infection, keratinization of the ocular surface, corneal ulceration and conjunctiva squamatization.\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] [0004]\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] Therefore, dry eye syndrome is a very serious disease that affects 5‑10% of the population, especially those who\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] work long hours in front of computer and those after the middle age. More than 30% patients in today’s ophthalmologist\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] clinics aredry eye patients. Despite the large number ofpatients withdry eyesyndrome in China, thereis nodrug approved\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] for the treatment ofdry eye syndrome. The patient can only have temporary relieffrom artificial tears. Therefore,there is an\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] urgent need for drugs for treating dry eye syndrome.\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] [0005]\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] The incidence of dry eye syndrome is directly proportional to the age, about 20% of people over 50 years old have\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] different degrees ofdryeye syndrome; gender also affects dry eye syndrome, andwomen, especially older women, have a\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] much higher percentage of dry eye syndrome than men, which may be related to the secretion of sex hormones; white-\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] collar workers stay for a long time in the air-conditioned environment, and the long-term use of the screen also causes a\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] high incidence of dry eye syndrome in this population. Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar:\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage.\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug;\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] [0006]\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] US 2014/256684A1 discloses the compound ethyl hydrogen ({[(2S)‑4-methyl‑2‑({[4‑(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] carbamoyl}amino)pentanoyl]amino}methyl)p hosphonate used for the treatment of dry eyes. The compound, among\n",
      "[PARAGRAPH] others, is considered in the application as FPR2 agonist to exhibit ocular anti-inflammatory activity with chemical stability\n",

Dry eye syndrome is caused by multiple inducing factors, including age, gender, environment, medicine, surgery, and systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes, thyroid disease, and lymphoma. If dry eye disease is not diagnosed and treated properly, it may lead to further complications such as infection, keratinization of the ocular surface, corneal ulceration and conjunctiva squamatization.\",\n",

More than 30% patients in today's ophthalmologist clinics are dry eye patients. Despite the large number of patients with dry eye syndrome in China, there is no drug approved for the treatment of dry eye syndrome. The patient can only have temporary relief from artificial tears.

Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.\"\n",

      "    \"Tears provide long-lasting moisturization and lubrication to the eyes, which is the key to maintaining vision and eye comfort. Tears are composed of water, lipids, mucus, antibodies, and specific proteins with anti-infective properties. These components are secreted by specific glands located around the eyes. When there is an imbalance in the tear system, people will feel dry eyes.\",\n",
      "    \"Dry eye syndrome is a common ocular surface inflammatory disease. People with dry eye may experience eye pain, photosensitivity, itching, redness and blurred vision. Dry eye syndrome is caused by multiple inducing factors, including age, gender, environment, medicine, surgery, and systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes, thyroid disease, and lymphoma. If dry eye disease is not diagnosed and treated properly, it may lead to further complications such as infection, keratinization of the ocular surface, corneal ulceration and conjunctiva squamatization.\",\n",
      "    \"Therefore, dry eye syndrome is a very serious disease that affects 5-10% of the population, especially those who work long hours in front of computer and those after the middle age. More than 30% patients in today's ophthalmologist clinics are dry eye patients. Despite the large number of patients with dry eye syndrome in China, there is no drug approved for the treatment of dry eye syndrome. The patient can only have temporary relief from artificial tears. Therefore, there is an urgent need for drugs for treating dry eye syndrome.\",\n",
      "    \"The incidence of dry eye syndrome is directly proportional to the age, about 20% of people over 50 years old have different degrees of dry eye syndrome; gender also affects dry eye syndrome, and women, especially older women, have a much higher percentage of dry eye syndrome than men, which may be related to the secretion of sex hormones; white-collar workers stay for a long time in the air-conditioned environment, and the long-term use of the screen also causes a high incidence of dry eye syndrome in this population. Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.\",\n",
