## Description

### Technical field

5 **[0001]** The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceuticals, and in particular to phosphorus-containing compound, preparation method thereof, and use for treating dry eye.

### Technical background

10 **[0002]** Tears provide long-lasting moisturization and lubrication to the eyes, which is the key to maintaining vision and eye comfort. Tears are composed of water, lipids, mucus, antibodies, and specific proteins with anti-infective properties. These components are secreted by specific glands located around the eyes. When there is an imbalance in the tear system, people will feel dry eyes.

15 **[0003]** Dry eye syndrome is a common ocular surface inflammatory disease. People with dry eye may experience eye pain, photosensitivity, itching, redness and blurred vision. Dry eye syndrome is caused by multiple inducing factors, including age, gender, environment, medicine, surgery, and systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes, thyroid disease, and lymphoma. If dry eye disease is not diagnosed and treated properly, it may lead to further complications, such as corneal ulcers and even blindness.

20 **[0004]** Therefore, dry eye syndrome is a very serious disease that affects 5-10% of the population, especially those who work long hours in front of a computer and those after the middle age. More than 30% patients in today's ophthalmologist clinics are dry eye patients. Despite the large number of patients with dry eye syndrome in China, there is no drug approved for the treatment of dry eye syndrome. The patient can only have temporary relief from artificial tears. Therefore, there is an urgent need for drugs for treating dry eye syndrome.

25 **[0005]** The incidence of dry eye syndrome is directly proportional to the age, about 20% of people over 50 years old have different degrees of dry eye syndrome; gender also affects dry eye syndrome, and women, especially older women, have a much higher percentage of dry eye syndrome than men, which may be related to the secretion of sex hormones, while-come women have a long time in the use of contact lenses, environmental factors, and other reasons. The incidence of dry eye syndrome in the population is high. Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitegrast. The drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug has a low efficacy rate, and only 50% of patients have a significant improvement.

30 **[0006]** US 2014/256684A1 discloses the compound dry hydrogen ((4(2S)-4-methyl-2-((4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)carbamoyl)amino)pentanoyl)amino)methyl)phosphonate used for the treatment of dry eyes. The compound, among others, is considered in the application as FPR2 agonist to exhibit ocular anti-inflammatory activity with chemical stability and suitable for ocular delivery. It is said that FPR2 represents an important novel pro-resolutory molecular target for the development of new therapeutic agents in ocular diseases with excessive inflammatory responses.

### Summary of the Invention

45 **[0007]** The invention is related to a new immune cell migration inhibitor. It has good hydrophilicity and can be developed into eye drops. It has a strong inhibitory effect on immune cell migration and can alleviate the symptoms of most dry eye patients.

50 **[0008]** The invention provides a series of phosphorus-containing compounds, the particular features are represented by the following structure:
