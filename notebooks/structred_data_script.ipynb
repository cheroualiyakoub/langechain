PCR is commonly used in medical and biological research laboratories to undertake a variety of tasks, such as diagnosis of infectious diseases, gene cloning, phenotype identification of experimental animals, transcriptome research, detection of genetic diseases, identification of genetic fingerprints, and paternity testing. Because of unrivaled abilities of PCR to replicate and be precise, it is considered by molecular biologists to be a preferred method for nucleic acid detection. In the late 1990s, American ABI company launched Real Time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) technique and related products, which further developed PCR into a highly-sensitive, highly-specific and accurate quantitative nucleic acid sequence analysis technique.'},\n",

Different from the method of fluorescence quantitative PCR, which collects fluorescence at each amplification cycle, digital PCR collects a fluorescence signal of each reaction unit independently at the end of amplification, and finally works out an original number of copies or concentration of a target molecule through the principle of Poisson distribution and the ratio of positive/negative reaction units.'},\n",

Since digital PCR only determines two amplification states of \"yes/no\" when performing result interpretation, there is also no need to detect an intersection of a fluorescence signal and a set threshold line, and it is completely independent of identification of the Ct value, so that the impact of amplification efficiency on digital PCR reaction and result interpretation is greatly reduced, and the tolerance to a PCR reaction inhibitor is greatly improved. In addition, the process of distributing the reaction system in a digital PCR experiment may greatly reduce the concentration of a background sequence that competes with a target sequence locally, and thus digital PCR is particularly suitable for detection of a rare mutation in a complex background, and is currently mostly applied in liquid biopsies to achieve detection of rare mutation markers in peripheral blood of tumor patients.'},\n",

Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.'}],\n",

Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.'}]},\n",

Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.'}]},\n",

Dry eye syndrome is caused by multiple inducing factors, including age, gender, environment, medicine, surgery, and systemic diseases such as autoimmune diseases, diabetes, thyroid disease, and lymphoma. If dry eye disease is not diagnosed and treated properly, it may lead to further complications such as infection, keratinization of the ocular surface, corneal ulceration and conjunctiva squamatization.'},\n",

Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.'}]},\n",

Dry eye syndrome is a continuous pathological process in which the condition progresses from light to severe, and there is no obvious boundary between light, medium and severe. Despite the complex etiology of dry eye syndrome, studies find that the pathology of dry eye caused by various causes is similar: immune cells invade the surface tissue of the eyes and trigger chronic inflammation, causing ocular surface damage. Currently, two drugs are approved in the European and American markets: (1) cyclosporin A suspension. This medicine is a very powerful immune system inhibitor, so it may cause damage to the immune system. At the same time, because it is a suspension, there are problems concerning long-term storage stability, and the eye irritation in the patients using the drug; (2) Lifitigrast, the drug was approved by the US FDA in December 2016, which is an immune cell migration inhibitor, and achieves the therapeutic effect by blocking the immune cells from entering into the site of inflammation; however, the drug is highly lipophilic and has no clinical effect on >50% of patients.'}]},\n",
