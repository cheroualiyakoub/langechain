    "abstract": "The present invention relates to genetically modified plants with enhanced drought resistance through the introduction of specific drought-tolerance genes. The modified plants exhibit improved water use efficiency, reduced water loss, and maintained crop yield under water-stress conditions. The invention includes methods for introducing drought-resistance genes using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, plant transformation protocols, and selection markers for identifying successfully modified plants. The resulting transgenic plants show significant improvements in survival rates and productivity in arid and semi-arid environments."
